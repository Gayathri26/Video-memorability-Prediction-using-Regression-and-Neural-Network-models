# Video-memorability-Prediction-using-Regression-and-Neural-Network-models
In this digital era, with the increasing population the social 
media and digital content is also increasing rapidly. Amidst this 
humongous data, it is difficult to retrieve useful information 
and moreover it is highly essential for companies like Twitter 
to keep up with the trend. In order to meet this requirement and 
determine people’s interest, prediction of video memorability 
plays a great role. In general, memorability means the ability to 
remember something and companies ponder on various factors, 
which decide on the state of getting recognized in short term or 
even after long term duration. In this project, the significance of 
various pre-computed visual features that were already 
provided by the MediaEval 2018 are explored. Among the 
various features, C3D and HMP and a combination of both are 
used to predict short and long term memorability using various 
Machine Learning models such as Linear Regression, Random 
Forests, Gradient Boosting Regressor and Neural Network. 
Finally, these models are evaluated using the Spearman’s 
Correlation Coefficient for short term and long term scores 
respectively.
